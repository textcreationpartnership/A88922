            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>I <hi>Beseech You, Bretheren, by the Mercies of God,</hi> that you now give your Serious Attention, unto the <hi>Returns</hi> which you are to make for those <hi>Mercies,</hi> declared in
<q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>ROM. XII. 1.</hi>
                  </bibl> I beseech you therefore, Brethren, by the Mercies of God, that yee present your Bodies, a Living Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, Holy, Acceptable unto God: Your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Service.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AS <hi>Reasonable</hi> a Thing certainly, as ever was proposed, in the World!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christians,</hi> I have set before you, a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of Sacred Scripture, worthy to be <hi>Written,</hi> as once the whole <hi>New Testament</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this is a part, was upon the Walls of a Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Monastery, <hi>In Letters of Gold;</hi> Yea, to be <hi>Written</hi> on the <hi>Fleshly Tables</hi> of our <hi>Hearts</hi> for ever.</p>
            <p>We find this passage, in an Epistle Directed unto the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and an Epistle, which insisting on that Great Article of <hi>Justification</hi> only by Faith in the Obedience of the Lord Jesus Christ, which is the main Thing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:136188:3"/> denyed by the present Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and on the Conversion of the <hi>Israelitish Nation,</hi> which is to be <hi>Consequent</hi> on, and perhaps a little <hi>Effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by, the Destruction to come shortly on the present Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> in those, as well as in other Notable Things, it mentions matters, wherein the <hi>Apostatical</hi> Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is in a peculiar manner concerned.</p>
            <p>But <hi>we</hi> also are concerned in these Things; and <hi>this Day,</hi> Eminently concerned in the Text now to be considered.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctrinal</hi> part of this Epistle, being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched in the first Eleven Chapters, the <hi>Practical,</hi> is comprized in the Five last; And this part, begins with a most Universal, &amp; most Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive <hi>Exhortation.</hi> Wherein we may note,</p>
            <p>First, The <hi>Matter</hi> of the Advice. This is, That we do make our <hi>Bodies,</hi> which by a <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdoche,</hi> implies our whole <hi>Selves,</hi> our <hi>Souls,</hi> our <hi>Names,</hi> our <hi>Friends,</hi> our <hi>Estates,</hi> and all our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> unto God: which is done, in short, by Devoting them unto the Service of that God.</p>
            <p>Next, The <hi>Manner</hi> of pressing it. This is, with, A Compellation, <hi>Brethren:</hi> An Obtestation, <hi>I beseech you;</hi> And a very weighty Argument, <hi>By the Mercies of God;</hi> that is to say, The <hi>Mercies</hi> of God lay upon us, a very powerful Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation hereunto.</p>
            <p>But we have not yet given the Text so par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular an <hi>Illustration,</hi> as it seems to call for.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:136188:3"/> Know then, That according to the Stricter No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> its more general Distinction, is into <hi>Propitiatory,</hi> or <hi>Eucharistical.</hi> Now Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity in that Notion admits but <hi>One,</hi> and this of the <hi>former sort;</hi> by which <hi>One,</hi> even <hi>that of Himself,</hi> our Lord <hi>hath forever perfected them that are Sanctified:</hi> He is a <hi>Poor Priest,</hi> who dreams of any other. We our selves, or any Things that we do, in <hi>Religion,</hi> are capable of being <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> only by way of <hi>Analogy,</hi> &amp; that chiefly to the latter sort; <hi>So,</hi> we <hi>offer up Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</hi> A <hi>Sacrifice</hi> here signifies no more, than a <hi>Thing Devoted unto God.</hi> But what are we thus to <hi>Devote?</hi> Our <hi>Bodies.</hi> Hereby we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand our <hi>whole Selves;</hi> but it is Expressed by, <hi>Your Bodies,</hi> for Distinction sake: the <hi>Bodies</hi> of <hi>Beasts</hi> were heretofore Offered, and now we are to Offer up <hi>Our own.</hi> This is called, a <hi>Living <hi>Sacrifice,</hi>
               </hi> because the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of old was to be brought <hi>Alive</hi> unto the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d; the <hi>Israelites</hi> might not themselves <hi>Eat</hi> a thing <hi>Dead</hi> of it self, much less might they bring such a Thing to the <hi>Living God.</hi> And yet the Victim was to be <hi>Slain,</hi> in <hi>Sacrificing;</hi> which is here opposed, by an Intimation, that when we <hi>Sacrifice</hi> our <hi>Bodies</hi> to the Lord, they yet continue to <hi>Live:</hi> Our <hi>Lives</hi> will not be at all <hi>Impaired,</hi> by the commanded <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of our Bodies, no, they will be <hi>Improved</hi> by a wonderful <hi>Sacredness</hi> added thereunto. Our <hi>Bodies</hi> are to be an <hi>U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>bloody Sacrifice:</hi> And yet the <hi>Bodily Life</hi> also is herein
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:136188:4"/> but alluded unto: 'tis a further, an Higher, a Nobler <hi>Living,</hi> a <hi>Living</hi> unto the Lord Jesus Christ, that is here called for. <hi>Holy,</hi> is annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without any Tautology; for though it be in our word, <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> it is not in the Greek word, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And besides, the Real <hi>Holiness</hi> or the Rectitude of Mind, and Walk, which attends our <hi>Sacrificing</hi> of our selves unto God, is here pointed at. What is <hi>Holiness,</hi> but a <hi>Devotion</hi> of our selves unto the Lord Jesus Christ? This will be <hi>Acceptable.</hi> Indeed our <hi>Sacrifice</hi> becomes not <hi>Acceptable By</hi> this; and yet, it is <hi>not</hi> Acceptable <hi>without</hi> it: We have been told, that all our Sacrifices, are <hi>Acceptable to God, by <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>Holiness,</hi> in the Nature of the Thing it self, is <hi>Well pleasing</hi> unto God. And, In all this there is a <hi>Reasonable Service;</hi> This intimates the <hi>Transcendency</hi> of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> required; they are not <hi>B uits</hi> but <hi>Men,</hi> that are to be a <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> and the Highest <hi>Acts of Reason</hi> too, are to be the Ingredients of the <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> and the <hi>Right</hi> of God hereunto is also signified; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so <hi>Reasonable,</hi> as that we should Offer our selves unto Him.

               </hi> thus, our <hi>Service</hi> is then most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and effectually yielded unto <hi>God,</hi> when we distinctly put the <hi>Name</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST upon all, as being a <hi>Service</hi> intended for <hi>Him</hi> immediately. All the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:136188:5"/> unto us, comes thro' the Hand of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, the <hi>God man,</hi> and the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi> Hence, tho' it were an Impiety, to Exclude the Consideration of God the <hi>Father,</hi> or of God the <hi>Spirit,</hi> in that <hi>Service</hi> which we are to render unto God for His <hi>Mercy,</hi> yet we then render it after the most <hi>Christian manner,</hi> when we carry the Lord JESUS CHRIST in our Thoughts, as the next Object of it. Wherefore, in the Meditations which I am to give you, I shall study still to insert the <hi>Name</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, as calling for that <hi>Service,</hi> which is to be done in the whole of our <hi>Obedience</hi> unto God. And this I do the rather, because of a boiling An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy in my Soul, against the <hi>Paganism</hi> of those Traitors unto the King of Heaven, who tho' they call themselves <hi>Divines,</hi> yet would have their Sermons and Writings valued, for the same cause that Blessed <hi>Austin</hi> undervalued the Books of their Brother <hi>Cicero, Quia Nomen Christi non est ibi;</hi> the <hi>Name</hi> of the Lord JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST is not there. Nor indeed, would we be so profane, as to reckon it a <hi>Battology,</hi> or a <hi>Superfluity,</hi> in the <hi>Fourteen E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> that this dearest Name occurrs four <hi>hundred and fifty Times</hi> therein, and no less than <hi>ten Times</hi> in the <hi>Ten First Verses</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Thing which I assert is, That the <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to God, which His Innumerable &amp; Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallellable
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:136188:5"/>
               <hi>Mercies</hi> unto us, do call for, is, That we <hi>Devote</hi> our selves unto the <hi>Service</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST; who <hi>to this End both Died and Rose, that He might be the LORD of all.</hi> To <hi>Serve</hi> the Lord JESUS CHRIST, what is that? Briefly, 'Tis to make fit <hi>Acknowledgments</hi> of His Infinite <hi>Excellencies,</hi> and bring others to join with us in making of such <hi>Acknowledgments.</hi> It is to bear our <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> unto the <hi>Truths</hi> and unto the <hi>Wayes</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and Conform our selves unto His <hi>Will.</hi> Now to <hi>Devote</hi> our selves hereunto, is our <hi>Acceptable Sacrifice;</hi> For we are assured, <hi>He that Serveth Christ, is Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God.</hi> And we are thus to proceed in our doing of it.</p>
            <p>First, We are to be convinced and satisfied of this; That the <hi>Service</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, is the most <hi>Reasonable Service.</hi> The Lord JESUS CHRIST, is the <hi>True God,</hi> the <hi>Great God,</hi> the <hi>Mighty God,</hi> and <hi>GOD over all, Blessed for ever.</hi> The Lord JESUS CHRIST, is He, whom all the <hi>Angels</hi> adore, as the <hi>Lord of Hosts,</hi> the Creator and Preserver of the World; and the most High, <hi>Possessor of Heaven and Earth.</hi> The Lord JESUS CHRIST i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> He, to whom we are beholden for all the <hi>Good</hi> Things that ever we do enjoy. HE particularly, tho' He were <hi>Equal with God,</hi> nevertheless <hi>Took on Him the Form of a Servant,</hi> for our Good. Upon the view of all this, we are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:136188:6"/> it infinitely <hi>Reasonable,</hi> that we should for ever be the <hi>Devoted Servants</hi> of such a Lord. But the Benefits of <hi>Redemption</hi> which we have by our Lord JESUS CHRIST, are to have a very particular consideration, among the <hi>Reasons</hi> of our <hi>Serving</hi> Him. If we <hi>Serve</hi> Him not, we <hi>Deny the Lord that Bought us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are hereupon to <hi>Dislike,</hi> and <hi>Renounce</hi> every <hi>Service</hi> inconsistent with that of the Lord JESUS CHRIST. The proposals which those Hellish <hi>Taskmasters,</hi> the FLESH, the WORLD, and the DEVIL, make unto us, we should Reject with all possible Abhorrence; and be al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ogether impatient of the <hi>Drudgeries,</hi> which we undergo, while we are under their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
            <p>We are herewithal to <hi>Resolve</hi> that the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, shall with His Assistences, be our Everlasting Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is not a <hi>Cold Assent,</hi> but a <hi>Full purpose of Heart,</hi> with which we are to <hi>Cleave unto the Lord.</hi> And with a Resolution to undergo all the <hi>Self-denial</hi> therein called for, we must be able to say, <hi>Lord, I have inclined my Heart, to perform thy Statutes alwayes, even unto the End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are herein to give the full consent of our Souls unto the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> wherein our <hi>Bonds</hi> to the <hi>Service</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST are to be Signed by us. In the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Graee,</hi> it is demanded of us, whether we are willing that the Lord JESUS CHRIST,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:136188:6"/> should Enstate us in the <hi>Favour</hi> of God, by the vertue of His <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Intercession,</hi> and by His Gracious Influences Enable us, as persons <hi>United</hi> unto Himself, to <hi>Glorify</hi> God for ever, and by His own Divine Methods, both <hi>Instruct</hi> us, and <hi>Incline</hi> us, to come at that Final Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? And whether we are willing to Express our <hi>Thankfulness</hi> unto Him, for Delivering us from Spiritual and Eternal Miseries, by sincere Endeavours to <hi>Serve</hi> Him in <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> all our Dayes? We are now to give up our selves unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, by declaring our most Hearty <hi>Consent</hi> unto this <hi>COVENANT,</hi> in all the Terms of it. Our <hi>Baptismal Vow</hi> is thus to be Renewed, by our Professing in the most early years of our <hi>Youth</hi> and <hi>Choice,</hi> That we do for ever approve of the <hi>Dedication</hi> to the <hi>Service</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, which was visibly passed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us in our Infancy.</p>
            <p>And finally, We are now to Study, how to Improve our <hi>All,</hi> for the <hi>Service</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST; that He may have Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of Glory out of <hi>All.</hi> Having said with <hi>Joshua, I will Serve the Lord,</hi> we are to say unto our Lord JESUS CHRIST, as one once more improperly did unto another King, <hi>I am thine, my Lord, O King, and all that I have.</hi> It was required, in 1 Cor. 6.20. <hi>Glorify God in your Bodies, and in your Spirits, which are His.</hi> Yea, It was required, in 1 Cor. 10.30. <hi>Whether ye
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:136188:7"/> Eat or Drink, or whatever ye do, Do all to the Glory of God.</hi> Thus, whatever does in any Regard belong unto us, we should by our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration</hi> thereof unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, be able to say, <hi>This belongs unto the Lord!</hi> When any Tempters do Sollicit us, to abuse any thing that we have unto the <hi>Dishonour</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, we should Reply with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, <hi>How shall I do this Wickedness, and Sin against the Lord; the Lord whose I am, and whom I am to Serve?</hi> Instead thereof, All the <hi>Powers</hi> of our <hi>Spirits,</hi> our Understandings, our Fantasies, our Memories, our Wills, our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, are to be at work for the Lord JESUS CHRIST continually; All the <hi>Members</hi> of our <hi>Bodies,</hi> our Eyes, our Ears, our Tongues, our Hands and our Feet, are to be at work for the Lord JESUS CHRIST perpetually. All our <hi>Possessions,</hi> are to have, HOLINESS TO THE LORD, written on them; and we are to put them unto no use, but what may be for the <hi>Service</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST. Our <hi>Actions,</hi> every Day, should be Ennobled with Deliberate Thoughts, of <hi>Glorifying the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi>
               </hi> in what we do. Yea, we should be able to say, with the Apostle, in Phil. 1.21 <hi>To me to Live is Christ;</hi> by Spending our <hi>Lives</hi> in the <hi>Service</hi> of our Lord. It is <hi>thus,</hi> that we are to <hi>Present our selves a Sacrifice</hi> unto Him, that once made Himself a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for us!</p>

               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:136188:7"/>
               <hi>II.</hi> The <hi>Mercy</hi> of God unto us, is that which very Strongly <hi>Obliges</hi> us to this <hi>Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Very Various are the Courses taken by the God of Heaven, to Produce and Procure from us, that <hi>Service</hi> which we are to <hi>Honour</hi> our Lord JESUS CHRIST withal. 'Tis the <hi>Voice</hi> both of His <hi>Ordinances</hi> and of His <hi>Providences, Let men Serve the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and in all Things Obey the Will of that Glorious Lord.</hi> But the <hi>Mercies</hi> of God have this in a most particular manner, for the Language &amp; the Errand of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gratitude,</hi> as one says, <hi>Like the Blood in the Body, runs through the whole Practice of Christianity.</hi> The whole of that <hi>Obedience</hi> which we render unto God, is to be a continued Expression of <hi>Gratitude</hi> unto Him. Thus the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> make <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> a <hi>General Circumstance of sin;</hi> inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as though it be not in the <hi>Definition</hi> of <hi>sin,</hi> yet it is alwayes in the <hi>Perpretration</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>It ha's been sometimes a Question very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safely handled in the Books of some English Writers, <hi>What place in the Christian Religion is to be assigned unto Evangelical Obedience?</hi> Now we are not so grossly Ignorant of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> as to assert, <hi>That our Hearty and Honest Endeavour of Obeying the whole Will of God, is the condition upon which the Benefits purchased by Christ, belong unto us.</hi> God forbid, that we should Swallow down all the <hi>Poison</hi> Comprehended in that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion! We say, The only <hi>Condition</hi> on our part, Entitling us to the <hi>Benefits Purchased</hi> by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:136188:8"/> our <hi>Lord-Redeemer,</hi> is our <hi>Faith</hi> in Him, or the <hi>Reliance</hi> of our Souls upon the <hi>Free-Grace</hi> of God, in Him alone, for the Communication of those <hi>Benefits.</hi> And, <hi>Aliter qui vadit, Cadit!</hi> But then, the <hi>Place</hi> which we assign unto <hi>Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Obedience,</hi> is, that of <hi>Gratitude</hi> unto God, for the <hi>Benefits</hi> of <hi>Redemption;</hi> and we think, that the <hi>Principle</hi> which disposes us to <hi>Believe</hi> on the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and on His <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> will also dispose us to <hi>an Hearty and Honest Endeavour of Obeying the whole will of God,</hi> in <hi>Gratitude</hi> unto Him, for what Provision He ha's made for our <hi>Happiness</hi> in our Lord JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST. The Connexion between <hi>Justifying Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> Holy, Sincere, Thankful <hi>Obedience,</hi> is Infallible, and Insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; though we say likewise, that no man can do any Good Works of <hi>Obedience,</hi> until he be <hi>Justified.</hi> Nor does this place of <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> for our <hi>Happiness,</hi> which we assign to <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> hinder us, from Considering it, as the <hi>Way</hi> to our <hi>Happiness,</hi> Yea, as a <hi>Part</hi> of our <hi>Happiness.</hi> There is no true Believer, who is not of this Perswasion, <hi>I am an Happy man, if I may but Serve my Lord <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, Every <hi>Mercy</hi> of God unto us, calls for this Return. Almighty God therein does as he speaks, in Hos. 11.3. <hi>I drew them with the Cords of a man, with Bands of Love; I Laid meat unto them.</hi> When He dispenses Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses unto men▪ He propounds this as a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:136188:8"/> Expectation thereupon, <hi>These Kindnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are to be attractive of their Obedience; Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Creatures are Serviceable unto their Keepers, their Feeders, those that Lay meat unto them: and by doing thus for the Children of men, I do with Cords and Bands oblige them to Serve me for ever.</hi> Let us maintain this Truth, with a treble <hi>Demonstration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First; We have the <hi>Lessons</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> to show, That the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God, obliges our <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> to Him. The <hi>Scripture</hi> seems to put this <hi>Motto</hi> on every <hi>Mercy</hi> that we Receive, <hi>A strong Obligation to Serve the Lord <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </hi> Thus, When the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> received the <hi>Mercy</hi> of a mighty Deliverance, from woful Circumstances, what <hi>Use</hi> did their most Merciful Deliverer make of all? It was, A Demand of <hi>Obedience</hi> to all His Commandments. This is the Preface to both Tables of the Law, <hi>I am the Lord your God, that have brought you out of your Distresses, and now surely you can deny me no Obedience.</hi> And when Ten Thousand further <hi>Mercies</hi> had been shown to the People of God, this was the Inference deduced from them; <hi>Let these be acknowledged, with an Obedience an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable thereunto:</hi> Thus you have it, in Deut. 10.12. <hi>Now,</hi> (after all) <hi>What does the Lord thy God require if thee, but to Fear Him, to Love Him, to Serve Him, and to Obey Him?</hi> This was what <hi>Samuel</hi> once Preached unto a Great Congregation; in 1 Sam. 12.20. <hi>Only Fear
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:136188:9"/> the Lord, and Serve Him, for consider how great Things He hath done for you.</hi> This was what <hi>Paul</hi> has written to us all, in Rom. 2.4. <hi>The Goodness of God, O man, Leads thee to Repentance.</hi> And Symphonizing with all this, what says the Psalmist, in Psal. 130.4. <hi>There is Forgiveness with thee, O Lord, that thou mayst be feared?</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven so, we shall conclude but <hi>Scripturally,</hi> if we say, <hi>We have all Mercies from thee, O Lord, that thou mayst be Obeyed.</hi> Unto this purpose, it has been Remark'd, that when God had carried <hi>Israel</hi> over <hi>Jordan,</hi> there were <hi>Stones</hi> Erected for His <hi>Praise:</hi> But what was inscribed on the <hi>Stones?</hi> It was not the History of what had been done by God; but it was a <hi>Copy of the Law.</hi> An Intimation, that our <hi>Keeping of the Law,</hi> is to be no small Ingredient in our <hi>Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> of Him, that gave the <hi>Law;</hi> our <hi>Keeping of the Law</hi> is the Return that we are to make unto Him that has carried us well through our <hi>Jordans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly; We have the <hi>Complaints</hi> of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> to show, That the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God obliges our <hi>Obedience</hi> to Him. <hi>Heaven</hi> takes it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly, if we don't see an <hi>Obligation to Serve the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi>
               </hi> in every <hi>Mercy.</hi> It was the Expostulation of a provoked God, in Isa. 1.2. <hi>Hear, O Heavens, and give Ear, O Earth:</hi> Summoned they all are, to make <hi>Man</hi> Ashamed: Why, What's the matter? Alas, <hi>The Lord hath spoken, I have nourished &amp; brought
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:136188:9"/> up Children, and they have Rebelled against me.</hi> How bitterly 'tis Complained of, That <hi>Mercy</hi> should be bestowed upon us, and we not Return <hi>Obedience</hi> to the <hi>God of our Mercy!</hi> It is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned as a Provoking Evil, in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who was otherwise a Godly man: in 2 Chron. 32.25. <hi>He rendred not again, according to the Benefit done unto him, therefore was wrath upon him.</hi> And it is mentioned as a Provoking Evil, in <hi>Israel,</hi> on a Day of Humiliation, in Neh. 9.35. <hi>They have not Served thee, O Lord, in thy Great Goodness, which thou gavest them.</hi> So we see, That when a <hi>Benefit</hi> shall be done un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eat Goodness</hi> of God, and we don't <hi>render this again,</hi> that we shall <hi>Serve</hi> Him who gives all, the <hi>Wrath</hi> of God, is Enkindled upon such a <hi>Provocation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly; The utmost <hi>Obedience</hi> were due to God, though He should never confer any <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> at all upon us. Truly, such is the <hi>Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> such is the <hi>Authority,</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, that if HE say, <hi>Let such a Service be done for me!</hi> No man may dispute it: And, such are His <hi>Essential Perfections,</hi> that He will remain Worthy of all <hi>Service</hi> from us, though we were every one of us, Damned, among the Outcasts, in the lowest Hell forever: Tis from the Unreasonableness of Mankind, that there is any cause given for that Complaint, <hi>Vix diligitur Jesus Propter Jesum:</hi> Scarce is JESUS Loved and Served, for the pure sake of JESUS. Let
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:136188:10"/> the most miserable man, under the whole Cope of Heaven, keep <hi>Serving</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST unto Eternal Ages; Yet he must, own, as in Luk. 17.10. <hi>I have done but that which was my Duty to do.</hi> If God should strip us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately of all our Desireable Things, and cast us into the dismal shadows of the Second Death forever, we ought still to say, <hi>The Holy God still deserves all the Obedience that I can possibly yield unto Him.</hi> The <hi>Greatness</hi> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST renders Him worthy of all our <hi>Service,</hi> though we should have no particular motive of His <hi>Goodness</hi> unto us, to invite us thereunto. 'Tis said in Psal. 145.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Great is the Lord, &amp; Greatly to be Praised.</hi> So I say, <hi>Great is the Lord, and Greatly to be Served.</hi> It was a sweet speech that fell from the Pen of the Renowned Chancellour of <hi>Paris, I don't know what the Lord intends to do with me forever; but this I know,</hi> (Amari Dignus est et Coli) <hi>He is worthy that I should Love Him &amp; Serve Him; and I will do so.</hi> Though we were horribly bruised between the formidable Milstones of the Anger of God in the place of Dragons for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, yet it would become us ever to put this Accent on our Endless Lamentations, <hi>Yet This God is to be Obeyed!</hi> But what an <hi>Additional Obligation to Obedience,</hi> is by His <hi>Mercy</hi> then laid upon us? Let us now make some</p>

Oh, Examine thy self; <hi>Have I done any more Service to the Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> for all that Goodness &amp; Mercy, with which He is daily following of me?</hi> Now be we astonished at our own <hi>Unfruitfulness!</hi> It was a most <hi>Unrighteous</hi> Thing in <hi>Jeshurun,</hi> to give the Lord any Occasion to say, as in Deut. 32.15. <hi>Thou hast waxed Fat, and Kicked, &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook the God that made thee.</hi> It was a most <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovely</hi> Thing in <hi>David,</hi> that the Lord should have have any Occasion to say, as in 2 Sam. 12.9. <hi>I have done much for Thee; Wherefore hast thou despised the Commandment of the Lord?</hi> Let us with Trembling Souls, think, whether we shall not bring a <hi>Curse</hi> on our selves, by such a <hi>Barrenness?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, Secondly, 'Tis a <hi>Worse Thing</hi> then, to be the <hi>Worse</hi> for the <hi>Mercies</hi> of God. Some there are, who make the <hi>Mercies</hi> of God, the

                  <hi>Occasions,</hi> yea, the <hi>Instruments,</hi> of their <hi>Sin</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Him. There are <hi>Spiders,</hi> whom the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, Emboldens in <hi>Impiety</hi> and <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency:</hi> they Cavil after this rate, <hi>God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty is ready to Pardon, and why may not I allow my self in some Transgressions of His Law?</hi> The Apostle <hi>Jude</hi> hath flashed the hottest Brimstone of Hell, in the faces of those <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates;</hi> and indeed, Whatever Sins a <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate</hi> man may fall into, it will not be Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per at least for the sinner himself to count it questionable, Whether any <hi>Regenerate</hi> man can Deliberately thus, <hi>Turn the Grace of God into Wantonness.</hi> And what shall be said of them, who take <hi>Encouragement</hi> from their <hi>Prosperity,</hi> to Wallow Securely in those filthy puddles of Death, which they would otherwise be afraid of plunging themselves into? Say, Would you not be more <hi>Prayerful,</hi> and more <hi>Careful,</hi> in all your ways, and more Studious to <hi>Serve</hi> the Lord JESUS CHRIST, if you were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der those <hi>Deadly Bands,</hi> which ly upon such, or such of your Neighbours? <hi>Conscience,</hi> Do thy Office! Is there no Person among us, who ha's had, not only a <hi>Life,</hi> but a <hi>New Life,</hi> and a <hi>Life</hi> Sweetned with many Conveniencies, given to him? And yet, how does he now carry himself? Does not he <hi>Live</hi> more Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, more Worldlily, more Vainly, than he did before? Is he not like the Jewes, who having made their <hi>Offerings</hi> in the Temple said,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:136188:11"/>
                  <hi>We are now acquitted to do all Abominations,</hi> and run upon a New Score of Sinning? Yea, How common a Thing is it, for Persons to make the <hi>Mercies</hi> of God, the meer <hi>Fuel</hi> of their <hi>Lusts?</hi> It was the Crime of them, in Hos. 2.8. <hi>The Corn and Wine which I gave them, did they prepare for Baal.</hi> Thus it may be said of many, They would be less Wicked, if it were not for the <hi>Mercies</hi> which God <hi>gives</hi> unto them. Now, what an horrid thing is this? If <hi>David</hi> should have taken the <hi>Sword</hi> and the <hi>Bow</hi> that <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> gave him, and presently have Stab'd or Shot the Donour with it, would it not have been a most Villanous Act? But be it known to you, That you are <hi>Fighting against God,</hi> with Weapons of <hi>His own;</hi> yea, you are fighting for the <hi>Devil</hi> with them. Oh! Think of this, and Blush at the <hi>Horrible Thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>II.</hi> But there is an <hi>Exhortation</hi> to be now pressed upon us; That the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God may now <hi>Cause</hi> us to do, what it <hi>Calls</hi> us to do. <hi>I Beseech you, Brethren, by the Mercies of God,</hi> that you be thence prevailed withal, to become the <hi>Devoted Servants</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, in all <hi>New Obedience,</hi> which is to <hi>Present your selves a Sacrifice unto Him.</hi> The <hi>Affricans</hi> of old, would foolishly Worship the Creatures which did them any <hi>Benefit,</hi> as our <hi>Americans</hi> at this Day do the <hi>Fire,</hi> because of the Singular <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi> which they have therefrom. Yea, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:136188:12"/> of <hi>Troas</hi> worshipped the very <hi>Mice,</hi> because they had received a notable <hi>Benefit</hi> by an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of <hi>Mice,</hi> gnawing asunder the <hi>Bow Strings</hi> of their Enemies. But how unnatural then, will it be for <hi>us,</hi> to forget the <hi>Benefits</hi> done to us by our Lord JESUS CHRIST, or to decline the <hi>Service</hi> of Him that has done the <hi>Benefits?</hi> Indeed we cannot requite the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God unto us, by doing of any thing that shall be for His Advantage. Tho' the parts of <hi>Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> are well distributed by <hi>Aquinas,</hi> into <hi>Recognition,</hi> and <hi>Valuation,</hi> and <hi>Retribution,</hi> of the Divine <hi>Benefits;</hi> Yet, for this last point of <hi>Thankfulness,</hi> if the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> might justly say, <hi>How canst thou Recompense thy Parents, the things they have done for thee?</hi> Much more may we say, <hi>'Tis impossible for us to Recompense our Saviour, the things He hath done for us:</hi> And the Light of Nature it self dictates, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself allows, That no man can, <hi>Paria reddere Deo;</hi> or, make <hi>Equal Returns</hi> unto the Lord. We must say to our God, as in Psal. 16.2. <hi>My Goodness extendeth not unto thee.</hi> Nevertheless there are some Things, which the Lord graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously calls <hi>Retributions;</hi> and those are the <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Obedience,</hi> which the Showers of <hi>Mercy</hi> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon us, from Heaven do bespeak our yielding of. The <hi>Mercie</hi> of God is the Tillage which He Employes upon us; <hi>O Earth, Earth, Earth, Hear the Word of the Lord!</hi> Now the <hi>Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions</hi> which we are to make unto Him, are those
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:136188:12"/> which the Apostle mentions, in Phil. 1.11. <hi>The Fruits of Righteousness, which are unto the Glory and Praise of God.</hi> Wherefore, <hi>I beseech you, Brethren,</hi> to Consider such Things as these.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Consider,</hi> First, There are <hi>many,</hi> there are <hi>mighty,</hi> there are most <hi>Undeserved Mercies,</hi> which we have Received from the <hi>Open Hand</hi> of our God. There is no Comfortable Thing at any Time Enjoy'd by us, but what comes unto us, from the Hand of God in the Lord JESUS CHRIST. Verily, we must call Him, as in Psal. 59.17. <hi>The God of our Mercy.</hi> But oh! how much of His <hi>Mercy,</hi> are we on every side surrounded withal! There are <hi>General Mercies,</hi> wherein we all have our share. As we are <hi>Englishmen,</hi> we are Born to those <hi>Rights,</hi> which are preferrible to the <hi>Best Estates</hi> that can be acquired among any other Nations upon Earth. But as we are <hi>New-Englanders,</hi> we have our further <hi>Priviledges,</hi> which no People under the Sun, out of <hi>New England</hi> have. Here are things, whereof we may say, as the Jewish <hi>Rabbi</hi> said of <hi>Liberty, If the Heavens were Parchment, and the Seas were Ink, they would not suffice to Write the Praises due to God, on the account thereof.</hi> But besides, and above, and beyond, these <hi>Liberties,</hi> we have the <hi>Lib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rties</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> too, (the <hi>Mercies</hi> in the Text now before us most peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly referr'd unto!) in some Circumstances, which may cause us to sing, as in Psal. 147.20. <hi>God hath not dealt so with any Nation.</hi> But then,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:136188:13"/> there are <hi>Personal Mercies</hi> also, wherein all of us may Rejoice. We have our <hi>Common Mercies:</hi> the <hi>Mercies</hi> which attended our <hi>Infancy,</hi> and <hi>Education:</hi> the <hi>Mercies</hi> of the <hi>Provision</hi> hitherto made for all our <hi>Necessities:</hi> the <hi>Mercies</hi> of our <hi>Preservations</hi> from <hi>Dangers</hi> whereto we have often been Exposed: the <hi>Mercies</hi> of the <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which <hi>God has graciously given</hi> to us; <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> whereof we may say, as in Lam. 3.32. <hi>The Lords Mercies are New to us every morning.</hi> We have our <hi>Special Mercies</hi> too. It may be, <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Mercies</hi> are heaped upon us, with such <hi>Loads,</hi> as to distinguish us from, to dignifie us above, others round about us: Oh! compare our case, with the case of <hi>others,</hi> known to us, of whom we do not know, but that <hi>we</hi> have Sinned much more than <hi>they;</hi> and say, as in Psal. 16.6. <hi>I have a Goodly Heritage.</hi> Yea, but we have our <hi>Spiritual Mercies,</hi> to be Celebrated with the peculiar <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> of our <hi>Spirits.</hi> Our Everlasting <hi>Salvation</hi> is contrived in our Lord JESUS CHRIST: and in pursuance of that <hi>Salvation,</hi> our Lord has complied with all the Humbling Things, which the <hi>Justice</hi> of God required of our <hi>Surety:</hi> and that <hi>Great Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is Revealed and Offered unto <hi>us,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST hath been savingly Operating upon us, to make us Accept of that <hi>Salvation,</hi> and to Apply that <hi>Salvation</hi> unto us for-ever. Oh! say with a <hi>Spirit Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in God our Saviour,</hi> as in Luc. 1.78. <hi>Thro'
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:136188:13"/> the Tender mercy of our God, the Day Spring from on High hath visited us.</hi> Now, have we <hi>Deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> these <hi>Mercies?</hi> No, Not one of them. What are we, but the <hi>Dogs,</hi> that never merited a <hi>Crumb</hi> of all the Bounty that is fallen to us? We are <hi>Undeserving,</hi> and <hi>Ill-deserving,</hi> and <hi>Hell-deserving</hi> Wretches; and we must own, as in Gen. 32.10. <hi>Lord, I am not worthy of the Least, of all thy Mercies, which thou hast shewed unto thy Servant!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Consider,</hi> Secondly: All the <hi>Return</hi> that we can make unto God for His <hi>Mercies,</hi> is our <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi> in the <hi>Service</hi> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. If we would ask, and Oh! Let us ask, that convenient Question, <hi>What are the Thanks that our God would have of us, for all His Mercies?</hi> The Reply must be, <hi>Become the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and Obey Him with Universal Holiness.</hi> Or, we may take an Answer from Tit. 2.10. <hi>The Grace of God, that bringeth Salvation, teacheth us, to Deny all Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and Worldly Lusts, and Live Soberly, and Righteously, and Godlily.</hi> It is worth noting, how those Two Bad Qualities, are joyned, in 2 Tim. 3.2. <hi>Unthankful, Unholy.</hi> If men be not <hi>Holy,</hi> they are not <hi>Thankful.</hi> Do we Dream, that our All sufficient God will expect from us, <hi>Thousands of Rams, and Ten Thousands of Rivers of Oyl,</hi> by way of <hi>Thankfulness</hi> for His <hi>Mercies?</hi> No, He only says, <hi>Be you my Servants; Live unto me, while you Live upon me, Obey me by Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:136188:14"/> of Justice, and Loving of Mercy, and Walking Humbly before me, and I have enough.</hi> It was most ingenuously spoken, by the Dying Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, <hi>Alas, I have only two Brass Farthings for my Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> a sorry Body, and a sinful Soul: if He, to whom I am infinitely Endebted, will accept of these, He shall have them with all my Heart.</hi> Even so ought we to say; <hi>We are an Insolvent, a Desperate, sort of Debtors unto God; we never can pay Him any thing proportionable to what we have Received from Him; but if the unwearied Service of my Obedience may be acceptable to Him, I shall be glad; He shall have That, while I have any Being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Consider,</hi> Thirdly: If we do not Return the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST for His <hi>Mercies,</hi> we are chargeable with an odious <hi>Ingratitude;</hi> and <hi>Ingratitude</hi> is indeed the most <hi>odious</hi> thing Imaginable. We say, <hi>Ingratum dixeris, et omnia dixeris:</hi> As Good call a man, a <hi>Viper,</hi> or the Detestablest Thing you can imagine, as to say, <hi>He is Unthankful!</hi> I remember, the Prophecy concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the <hi>Israelitish</hi> Nation to a good State in the <hi>Latter Dayes,</hi> Expresses it so, in Hos. 3.5. <hi>They shall Fear the Lord, and His Goodness;</hi> that is, as a Converted Jew teaches me to Expound it, the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the <hi>Good Thing</hi> promised in the <hi>Eighty Fifth. Psalm.</hi> Syrs, Our Lord JESUS CHRIST, is a Lord so <hi>Good,</hi> that He is <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> it self; and how <hi>Ungrateful</hi> are we, if we
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:136188:14"/> do not <hi>Serve</hi> such a <hi>Lord!</hi> A <hi>Slave,</hi> that shall have his <hi>Meat,</hi> his <hi>Drink,</hi> his <hi>Cloathing</hi> and <hi>Lodging</hi> from a Good Master, is to be <hi>Beaten with many Stripes,</hi> if he be not like the Servant, of whom the Centurion his Master, said, <hi>I say to him, Do this, and he doth it.</hi> It was a Custom even among the <hi>Heathen,</hi> as our Lord Himself observes, that such as were their <hi>Benefactors,</hi> (their <hi>Baal-Hanans,</hi> and their <hi>Hannibals,</hi> their <hi>Gracious-Lords</hi>) they would make them their Governours, and Swear <hi>Allegiance</hi> unto them. And shall we then refuse to Serve our Lord in Heaven, the Lord of Heaven, who supplies all our wants, and is our <hi>Benefactor</hi> every moment? The Prophet <hi>Elisha,</hi> in 2 King. 4.12. thought it would have been a breach of <hi>Good Manners,</hi> if he had not asked a Courteous Hostess, <hi>Behold thou hast been careful of us; What shall be done for thee?</hi> Surely then, we should say with ourselves, <hi>What shall be done, what Service is there to be done for the Lord</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>who has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways careful of me?</hi> What a sordid man, was that <hi>Egyptian</hi> Butler, who <hi>forgat</hi> the <hi>Joseph,</hi> that had been so useful unto him? And is it not as vile a thing for us to Forget the <hi>God of our Lives?</hi> It was a base Temper that <hi>Nabal</hi> show'd, when <hi>David</hi> must say of him, in 1 Sam. 25.11. <hi>in vain have I kept all that this Fellow hath.</hi> And shall our Lord say of us. <hi>In vain have I thrown away all my Mercies upon such a Sinner: He is a meer Grave to my Mercies: He'l
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:136188:15"/> do no Service for me, Let me do never so much for Him.</hi> Syrs, the Lord will by dreadful Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, give us to understand, that He <hi>does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in vain.</hi> Oh! Let not that check belong unto us, in Deut. 32.6. <hi>Do ye thus Requite the Lord, O foolish people and unwise!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Consider,</hi> Fourthly; All <hi>the Service</hi> wherein we <hi>Obey</hi> the Lord JESUS CHRIST, for the Requital of His <hi>Mercies,</hi> will be as <hi>profitable</hi> to our selves, as <hi>acceptable</hi> to the Lord. Certainly, we shall not Lose by it! No, It will issue in the <hi>Continuation,</hi> and the <hi>Augmentation</hi> of our <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> As among men, 'tis a Delight unto us, to Do good unto the <hi>Thankful;</hi> So will the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God say, <hi>My Mercies are well bestow'd upon such a man; he shall have them still, he shall have more of them, he shall have as much as Heart can wish.</hi> Behold, how we may prevent the Loss of our <hi>Precious and Pleasant Things.</hi> Let us do <hi>Service</hi> for the Lord JESUS CHRIST, with what we have: So our <hi>Talents</hi> will not be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from us. Let us be <hi>Tenants,</hi> that shall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly pay the little <hi>Rents</hi> required of us, and we shall not be Turned out of all. And what a <hi>Sign</hi> shall we therein have of our <hi>Sincerity</hi> before the Lord? An <hi>Hypocrite</hi> will sometimes abstain from Evil, for fear of <hi>Rods</hi> and <hi>Blowes:</hi> Oh! but when a man is marvellously quickned unto the <hi>Service</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, by the Smiles of the Lord upon him, there is a most hopeful mark of <hi>Uprightness</hi> upon the Soul of such a man.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:136188:15"/>
               <p>Well, These Things being thus <hi>Considered,</hi> there are some Things, which I desire we may now find our selves disposed unto.</p>
               <p>First, Let us very particularly <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nder</hi> the <hi>Mercies</hi> of God unto us, in the Lord JESUS CHRIST. Retire, &amp; Look <hi>back,</hi> &amp; Look <hi>round,</hi> upon the Multifarious Loving kindness of our God unto us. As <hi>Ahashuerus</hi> in Est. 6.1. called for the <hi>Records,</hi> wherein he found Great Things that had been done for him; So let Us cast an Eye into the <hi>Records,</hi> which we <hi>Do,</hi> or <hi>Should</hi> keep, of the Great Things that God hath done for us. Oh! Let us make a <hi>Catalogue,</hi> as far as we can, of our <hi>Mercies:</hi> Nor indeed can we easily leave, a better <hi>Legacy</hi> to our <hi>Families,</hi> than such a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of our <hi>Ebenezers,</hi> of our Experiences.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let us very particularly <hi>Purpose</hi> the <hi>Service</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, for, and with, His <hi>Mercies.</hi> Retire, and put that Interrogatory unto our selves, in Psal. 116.12. <hi>What shall I Render to the Lord for all His Benefits?</hi> And pursuant hereunto, Let us choose to be the <hi>Servants</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, in all <hi>Holy Conversation.</hi> Imitate that Prince <hi>Cantacuzanus,</hi> who giving up himself unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, would afterwards have his Name Changed into <hi>Christodulus,</hi> or, <hi>A Servant of Christ.</hi> I tell you, Great Emperors were not the Smaller for Subscribing themselves, <hi>The Vassals,</hi> of this Lord. Yea, Let us often
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:136188:16"/> have our Explicit <hi>Contrivances,</hi> how to Glorify and Magni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y <hi>God our Saviour.</hi> 'Tis a Noble Question, that we should sometimes put unto our selves, <hi>What special Service may I do for my Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as I Stand in such a Relation, or such a Capacity?</hi> And in Answer to this Question, some singular ways to <hi>Do Good,</hi> will doubtless occur unto us.</p>
               <p>Finally, Let us Resign up our selves unto the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, that by His Influences, we may <hi>Present our selves a Living Sacrifice, Holy, and Acceptable unto God.</hi> We can do nothing of our selves, in this <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Service:</hi> but if once the <hi>Spirit</hi> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST shall take <hi>Possession</hi> of us, we shall then <hi>Serve</hi> Him faithfully, <hi>Serve</hi> Him fervently, <hi>Serve</hi> Him constantly; and be <hi>for Him, and not for another.</hi> In allusion to the old usage of Masters <hi>Branding</hi> their Servants, it was usual for the ancient Idolaters, to <hi>Brand</hi> themselves for the perpetual Service of the <hi>Idol</hi> whereto they were devoted, with such Marks as are forbidden in <hi>Leviticus.</hi> They some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Branded</hi> themselves, with the <hi>Mark</hi> of their <hi>Idol,</hi> as an <hi>Helmet</hi> was the <hi>Mark</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> and the <hi>Ivy</hi> was the <hi>Mark</hi> of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> They sometimes <hi>Branded</hi> themselves with the <hi>Name</hi> of their <hi>Idol;</hi> as, <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or the like, at large. And they sometimes <hi>Branded</hi> themselves with the <hi>Number</hi> of his <hi>Name;</hi> that is, with other <hi>Letters</hi> which together would amount unto the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:136188:16"/> same <hi>Number</hi> wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h the known Letters of his <hi>Name,</hi> agreed Privately among the fraternity, to signify <hi>So.</hi> I will not Report what some Zealous Persons among the People of God, in the Primitive Times, did in Opposition here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. But this I say; Lying at the Foot of Soveraign Grace, Let us, give up our selves to the <hi>Free Spirit</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST; and that <hi>Spirit</hi> will Effectually <hi>Mark</hi> us, and <hi>Hold</hi> us, to <hi>Service</hi> of that Lord Eternally. Come then, Let us Lay our selves in the Dust, at the Feet of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and say before Him; <hi>Lord, I would gladly be Thine, and there is infinite Reason that I should be so forever. Oh! how wonderful will be my Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and If thou wilt accept me to Serve thy Glorious Interests! Behold, I here Devote my self, and all that I am, and all that I have, unto thy Glory? But I am able to do nothing: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Oh! give me that Good Spirit of thine, which thou hast Promised unto them that ask it. Let that Spirit Seize me, fill me, act me, and make me an Instrument of thy Glory for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whatever ha's been done by the <hi>Mercies</hi> of God, for the man who does thus, I say, <hi>Believest Thou? Thou shalt see yet greater Things than Ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is Time to break off. We will now make an <hi>Echo</hi> to the Calls of Heaven which we have thus had,
<q>I Beseech you, by the Mercies of God, that ye present your Bodies, a Living Sacrifice, Holy, Acceptable to God, your Reasonable Service;</q>

               <p>By Digesting it into an <hi>Hymn,</hi> which may help to carry on the <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> wherein we are Engaged.</p>
